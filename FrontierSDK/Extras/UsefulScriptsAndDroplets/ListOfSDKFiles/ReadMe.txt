buildFolderOutline
-----------------

This Frontier desktop script creates an outline in your object database that contains a complete list of all the folders, sub-folders and files in Frontier SDK 3.0.  

Important: this script must run from this folder. Don't move it before running it.

It requires Frontier, it will not work with Frontier Runtime, since Runtime doesn't include Frontier's outliner.
